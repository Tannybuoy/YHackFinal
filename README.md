# yhack2020

## Inspiration
There are a lot of people unconvinced about climate change, despite growing scientific evidence. We were inspired by documentaries which talk about it, and the increasing minformation on social media claiming climate change to be a hoax and conspiracy theory.

## What it does
Our project is a website where a player visits islands which ask seemingly mundane questions about the daily life of the individual, unaware of the impact it has on the environment. Our objective is to make people realise the impact on the environment through the game and their answers. We want to give recommendations to people on where they can improve, and encourage those already contributing to saving the climate.

## How we built it
We did indepth research to collect our data in one place and get a user flow for the game. We used github to collaborate and for version control. With flask for python on the backhand to exchange information with the player, we have html and css files to control the look and feel of the website itself. 

## Challenges we ran into
With lack of programming experience in the team, the hackathon was a steep learning curve. Collaborating across 4 different timezones was difficult. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building a working website within the timeframe and being an all-female team!

## What we learned
Each of us has learnt something in the hackathon, be it flask, using github, video editing or user research. 

## What's next for One Earth
Looking to improve the front-end, incorporating a scoreboard to have a competitive environment. Deploying it to the public after better research and more questions.


**If running it in anaconda prompt in Windows 10:**
1) Navigate to yhack folder using `cd Documents/GitHub/yhack2020/yhack` , this will vary for you depending on where the yhack folder is located in your Desktop
2) run `pip install flask_session` on the command line
3) run `set FLASK_APP=application.py` on the command line
4) run `flask run` on the command line
